Version 1.0
20230709 - aka Seven of Nine ;-)

what you need:

* DCS 2.8.x
* the F-15E module by Razbam
* a Streamdeck XL 
* (!! IMPORTANT !!) Make sure software version for the streamdeck is above 6.x otherwise some functions will not work correctly
* DCS Interface ==> https://github.com/charlestytler/streamdeck-dcs-interface
* DCS Interface requires DCS Exports Scripts (https://github.com/asherao/DCS-ExportScripts).
* The F-15SE lua version included (forked from the fantastic trigati's version)
* inspired by and borrowing some of the great profiles from Ahsoul, Norsk_L and Tess

Once you have all DCS Export Scripts and DCS Interface running, just upload the profile and off you go...

Our goal is to provide you with a tool that gives you access to all the functionalities, you can then rearrange at will according to your ergonomic preferences !
